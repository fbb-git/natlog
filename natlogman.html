<h2 >NAME</h2>natlog - source-nat logging tool
<p>

<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
       <strong >natlog</strong> [OPTIONS] <em >command</em>
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Firewalls like <strong >iptables</strong>(1) may offer <em >POSTROUTING</em> (source network
address translation, snat) facilities changing the source address of a host
behind the firewall to the address of the host connected to the outer
world. With <em >snat</em> the following combinations of IP addresses and port
numbers are encountered:
    <ul>
    <li> the IP address and port number used by the host behind the firewall
initiating a connection to the outer world (the source host, in this manual
page referred to as <em >IPsrc, sport</em>);
    <li> the IP address and port number of the host that <em >IPsrc</em> connects to
(the destination host, in this manual page referred to as <em >IPdst, dport</em>);
    <li> the IP address and port number used by the firewalling host when
source natting <em >IPsrc</em> and <em >sport</em> (the firewall host, in this manual page
referred to as <em >IPfw, fwport</em>).
    </ul>
<p>
Source natting usually uses <em >sport</em> for <em >fwport</em>, but <em >fwport</em> may
already be in use, in which case the firewalling host must use another,
available port to forward communication from <em >IPsrc, sport</em> to <em >IPdst,
dport</em>. 
<p>
The general scheme that applies to source natting, therefore, looks like
this:
        <pre>

    IPsrc:sport is translated by the firewall to IPfw:fwport;
    IPfw:fwport is used when communicating with IPdst:dport.
        
</pre>

    From the perspective of the destination host the communication originates
at <em >IPfw::fwport</em> and consequently all communication (e.g., incident
reports) sent by the systems administrator maintaining <em >IPdst</em> to <em >IPfw</em>'s
systems administrator will refer to <em >IPfw:fwport</em>, rather than to
<em >IPsrc::sport</em>.
<p>
The standard log facilities provided by <em >iptables</em> do not easily allow
relating <em >IPfw:fwport</em> to <em >IPsrc:sport</em>, and <em >natlog</em> was developed
to fill in that particular niche.
<p>
<em >Natlog</em> provides data about source natting in various forms. The
standard logging mode consists of messages sent to the syslog daemon (cf.,
<strong >rsyslogd</strong>(1)) and/or to the standard output stream showing the essential
characteristics of connections using source natting. Here is an example of a
logged message (log-entries occupy single lines; the line-breaks below are to
enhance readability):
        <pre>

    NATLOG: from 1338990672:55588 thru 1338990747:807100 (UTC): tcp
        192.168.19.72:4467 (via: 129.125.90.132:4467) to 
        to 200.49.219.180:443; sent: 802, received: 7669
        
</pre>

    The values <em >1338990672:55588</em> and <em >1338990747:807100</em> are time stamps
showing the begin- and end-times in seconds:microseconds of a tcp connection
since the beginning of the epoch (Jan 1, 1970, 0:00 UTC). <em >Natlog</em> offers
the <em >--time</em> option for requesting human-readable time specifications like
<em >Nov 2 13:29:11</em> rather than time representations using seconds and micro
seconds.
<p>
The next value (<em >192.168.19.72:4467</em>) represents <em >IPsrc::sport</em>. This
is followed by <em >129.125.90.132:4467</em>, representing <em >IPfw:fwport</em>. The
third pair of values (<em >200.49.219.180:443</em>) represents <em >IPdst:dport</em>. 
<p>
In this example, host <em >192.168.19.72</em>, using port <em >4467</em>, connected to
host <em >200.49.219.180</em>, port <em >443</em>. To this latter host the connection
appears to have originated from <em >129.125.90.132</em> port <em >4467</em>. The log
message allows us to associate this with the `real' host and port from which
the connection originated: <em >192.168.19.72:4467</em>.
<p>
The final entries show the number of bytes that were sent by the
source-host (<em >IPsrc</em>) and received from the destination-host (<em >IPdst</em>).
<p>
When <em >natlog</em> is terminated it can no longer track connections that are
still open. If <em >natlog</em> was terminated (by a <em >SIGINT</em> or <em >SIGTERM</em>
signal), then it logs a `terminating' line, followed by an overview of all
(potentially) still open connections. Those connections are flagged with a
trailing '(EOP)' (end of program) log-element, and their end-times show
<em >natlog's</em> termination time. Incomplete connections show <em >(INCOMPLETE)</em>.
<p>
In addition to the standard logs the option <em >--log-data</em> is
available. This option requires the path to a file where information is logged
in tabular form, which can easily be processed by statistical software like
<strong >R</strong>(1). When specifying this option information will be appended to an
existing file. When the log file does not yet exist it is created. The first
line of the thus written log files names the columns of the table. The column
names are (all on one line):
    <pre>

    type, srcNr, srcIP, srcPort, dstNr, dstIP, dstPort, 
        sent, recvd, begin,  end, beginTime, endTime, status 
    
</pre>

    Most column labels will be self-explanatory. <em >Type</em> indicates the
connection type, logged as <em >icmp, tcp,</em> or <em >udp</em>; <em >srcNr</em> and <em >dstNr</em>
are the 32 bit numeric values of, respectively, the source host's IP address
and the destination host's IP address (decimal representations); <em >begin</em> and
<em >end</em> are the times in seconds since the beginning of the epoch,
corresponding to the times displayed at, respectively, <em >beginTime</em> and
<em >endTime</em>; <em >status</em> indicates the status of the logged connection
information: <em >ok</em> indicates a connection that was normally completed;
<em >incomplete</em> indicates that the connection was recognized, but was not
normally completed; <em >eop</em> is used for connections that were still active by
the time <em >natlog</em> terminates. When the status equals <em >incomplete</em>, the
time entries show the times of receiving the first and last packets of that
connection; when <em >eop</em>, then the <em >end</em> and <em >endTime</em> entries show
<em >natlog's</em> termination time.
<p>
Log entries look like this (each entry occupies one line, header line and
logged data lines are right-aligned):
    <pre>

    tcp, 101820608,    192.168.17.6,        48886, 
        4012145084,  188.121.36.239,           80,       
               430,            2266,   1517387644,    1517387644, 
        Jan 31 08:34:04:318340, Jan 31 08:34:04:383170,  ok
    
</pre>

<p>
<h2 >MODES AND COMMANDS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <em >conntrack</em>: the `conntrack'-mode. This command can only be used on
platforms using <strong >iptables</strong>(1) where <strong >conntrack</strong>(1) has also been
installed. Information about source-natted connections is obtained from
<strong >conntrack</strong>(1)'s output. In this mode all, or one of the (by default) tcp,
udp, and icmp layer four protocols can be monitored.
<p>
By default <em >conntrack</em> does not report byte counts. To have conntrack
report byte counts the command
    <pre>

     $ echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_acct
    
</pre>

    must have been issued before starting <em >conntrack</em>. 
<p>
<em >Conntrack</em> includes the sizes of the IP headers (usually 20 bytes) in
reported byte counts. Thus, <em >icmp</em> packets are usually reported as having
size 84, even though <strong >ping</strong>(1) reports a payload of 64 bytes. Since the
actual sizes of IP headers cannot be determined from conntrack's output, the
sizes reported when using <em >natlog's</em> conntrack mode are as reported by
<em >conntrack</em>, and are therefore not corrected for IP header lengths. The
option <em >--conntrack-ip-header-size</em> can be used to correct for the (assumed)
IP header sizes.
<p>
See also the <em >conntrack-command</em> option.
<p>
<li> <em >indevice outdevice</em>: the `devices'-mode. Here, <em >indevice</em> is the
name of the device behind the firewall: addresses living behind the
<em >indevice</em> are source-natted to the firewall host's IP address when passed
on to the <em >outdevice</em>;
<p>
<em >outdevice</em> is the name of the device where source-natted packets are
forwarded to, and from where replies for source-natted hosts living behind the
<em >indevice</em> are received. With this command all, or any combination of the
(by default) tcp, udp, and icmp layer four protocols can be monitored.
<p>
<li> <em >infile in-address in-mask outfile out-address out-mask</em>: the
`tcpdump'-mode. This command can be used to process <strong >tcpdump</strong>(1) generated
binary files, generated on the source-natting host. If a source natting host
uses interface <em >eth1</em> behind the firewall and <em >eth0</em> to connect to the
outside world, then the follow <em >tcpdump</em> commands produce the required
binary files (these commands will normally be run in the background, hence the
trailing <em >&amp;</em>):
        <pre>

    tcpdump -wi eth0 /tmp/eth0 &amp;
    tcpdump -wi eth1 /tmp/eth1 &amp;
        
</pre>

    To have <em >natlog</em> process these files, terminate the <em >tcpdump</em>
commands, and transfer the files <em >/tmp/eth0</em> and <em >/tmp/eth1</em> to the host
where  <em >natlog</em> has been installed. The required addresses and masks are
shown by the <strong >ifconfig</strong>(1) command. E.g.,
        <pre>

eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
      inet 129.125.1.123  netmask 255.255.0.0  
                          broadcast 129.125.255.255

eth1: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  
                          broadcast 192.168.1255
        
</pre>

    The relevant info is shown in the lines following the interface's name:
the value following <em >inet</em> is the interface's IP address, and the value
following <em >netmask</em> is the network's mask. 
<p>
Combining files and addresses, <em >natlog</em> is run as follows (all on one
line):
        <pre>

    natlog  /tmp/eth0 129.125.1.123  255.255.0.0 
            /tmp/eth1 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
        
</pre>

    Instead of fully specifying the netmask, netmaks specifications like /24
are also accepted. In that case the number following the slash indicates the
number of non-zero bits of the netmask. In practice, each value of the netmask
is either 255 (8 bits are set) or 0 (0 bits are set), and so 255.255.0.0 can
also be specified as /16, while 255.255.255.0 can be specified like /24.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >OPTIONS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong >--config</strong>=<em >config-path</em> (<strong >-c</strong>)<br/>
       The argument <em >config-path</em> defines the path to <em >natlog's</em>
        configuration file. By default it is <em >/etc/natlog.conf</em>. All
        configuration options have defaults, which are used when no
        configuration file and no command-line options were provided.
<p>
All options, except for <em >config, help, verbose</em> and <em >version</em> can
        also be specified in the configuration file. The configuration file
        ignores empty lines and all information on lines beginning with a
        hash-mark (<em >#</em>). In the configuration file initial hyphens should be
        omitted, and option names may immediately be followed by a
        colon. Multi-word arguments should not be surrounded by
        quotes. Examples:
       <pre>

    stdout
    syslog-facility: LOCAL0
        
</pre>

       Command-line options override configuration file options.
<p>
<li> <strong >--conntrack-command</strong>=<em >path [options]</em><br/>
       The path and options to the <strong >conntrack</strong>(1) program. By default this
        is 
       <pre>

    /usr/sbin/conntrack -p tcp -E -n -o timestamp -e NEW,DESTROY
        
</pre>

        resulting in:<br/>
<p>
- Monitoring the tcp layer four protocol;<br/>
       - Displaying real-time event logs (<em >-E</em>);<br/>
       - Displaying time stamps (<em >-o timestamp</em>);<br/>
       - Logging all new and destroyed (ended) events (<em >-e
            NEW,DESTROY</em>);<br/>
<p>
By default <em >tcp</em> is monitored. Other protocols can be configured
        using the <em >--protocol</em> option.
<p>
The <em >conntrack</em> program must be available when requesting
        <em >natlog</em>'s <em >conntrack</em> command. Layer four protocols other than
        tcp, udp and icmp are currently not supported. A subset of the
        supported protocols may be requested using <em >conntrack's -p tcp, -p
        udp</em> or <em >-p icmp</em> options.
<p>
<li> <strong >--conntrack-device</strong>=<em >dev</em><br/>
       By default <em >conntrack</em> monitors the information made available at the
        <em >/proc/net/nf_conntrack</em> device. When another device is used, it can
        be specified using this option.
<p>
<li> <strong >--conntrack-ip-header-size</strong>=<em >size</em><br/>
       This option can be used to correct for the IP header sizes. By default,
        <em >conntrack</em> includes these sizes in reported byte counts. By
        specifying this option packet sizes reported by <em >conntrack</em> are
        reduced by <em >size</em>. Commonly IP headers consist of 20 bytes (so, to
        correct for this specify <em >--conntrack-ip-header-size 20</em>).
<p>
<li> <strong >--conntrack-restart</strong>=<em >max</em><br/>
       If the conntrack process prematurely ends it is restarted at most
        <em >max</em> times (these are pure <em >restarts</em>: conntrack's initial
        startup is not counted for this option). By default 10 restarts are
        allowed.
<p>
<li> <strong >--help</strong> (<strong >-h</strong>)<br/>
       Write basic usage information to the standard output stream and
        terminate.
<p>
<li> <strong >--log</strong>=<em >argument</em><br/>
       By default <em >natlog</em> forwards log messages about <em >natlog</em> and
        connection information to the syslog daemon using the <em >DAEMON</em>
        facility with priority <em >NOTICE</em> (see below at the <em >syslog*</em>
        options). This is identical to specifying the argument
        <em >syslog</em>. Alternatively, specify the argument <em >off</em> to suppress
        writing log messages. Any other argument is interpreted as a
        path-specification to a file to receive the log messages: log-messages
        are appended to existing files. If the log file does not yet exist it
        is first created.
<p>
<li> <strong >--log-data</strong>=<em >path</em><br/>
       <em >Path</em> specifies the pathname of the file where information about
        observed connections is written in tabular form. Information is
        appended to existing files. If <em >path</em> does not yet exist it is first
        created. Refer to the <em >DESCRIPTION</em> section for information about
        the format of the generated table. Specify <em >""</em> as command-line
        option if the configuration file specifies a log data file but you
        don't want the data to be logged in a particular run of <em >natlog</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--log-rotate</strong>=<em >spec</em><br/>
       This option is used to specify the frequency and the number of
        log-files that are rotated. By default log-files are not rotated.<br/>
       Specify <em >time[mhd]</em> or <em >time[mhd]nFiles</em>. A time unit specification
        must follow <em >time</em> and is <em >m</em> for minutes, <em >h</em> for hours, and
        <em >d</em> for days. <em >nFiles</em> specifies the max. number of rotated
        files. If only <em >time[mhd]</em> is specified, then <em >nFiles</em> is set to
        1.  By default (or if <em >time</em> or <em >nfiles</em> are specified as zero)
        log files are not rotated.
<p>
<li> <strong >--no-daemon</strong><br/>
       By default, <em >natlog</em> runs in the background (a daemon). <em >Natlog</em>
        runs as an ordinary program (i.e., in the foreground when the option
        <em >no-daemon</em> is provided). When running as a daemon, <em >--stdout</em>
        (see below) is suppressed, and <em >--verbose</em> messages (see below) are
        sent to the syslog daemon, unless <em >--no-syslog</em> was specified. When
        using the tcpdump-mode <em >natlog</em> does not run in the background. In
        this case, if <em >no-daemon</em> is omitted a warning message is logged,
        and <em >natlog</em> continues as an ordinary program.
<p>
<li> <strong >--pid-file</strong>=<em >path</em> (<strong >-p</strong>)<br/>
       When <em >natlog</em> runs in the background, then <em >path</em> is the name of
        the path of the file holding the daemon's process-id. By default this
        is <em >/run/natlog.pid</em>. To end the daemon, send a <em >SIGINT</em> or
        <em >SIGTERM</em> signal to the process id mentioned in the
        <em >pid-file</em>. <em >Natlog</em> ignores <em >SIGHUP</em> signals (but writes a log
        message when receiving a <em >SIGHUP</em> interrupt).
<p>
<li> <strong >--protocol</strong>=<em >specification</em> (<strong >-P</strong>)<br/>
       The protocol(s) to monitor. By default the tcp layer four protocol is
        monitored. Currently <em >natlog's conntrack</em> command can monitor the
        tcp, udp, and icmp layer four protocols.  Using the <em >protocol</em>
        option (note: singular!)  any subset of these protocols can be
        selected by specifying a colon-separated subset of tcp, udp, and icmp
        (e.g., <em >--protocol udp:tcp</em>). The specification <em >all</em> can be used
        to monitor all three protocols (tcp, udp, and icmp). When using the
        conntrack-mode, only a single protocol (including <em >all</em>) can be
        specified.
<p>
<li> <strong >--stdout</strong> (<strong >-s</strong>)<br/> 
       Syslog-equivalent messages are sent to the standard output.
        This option is implied by <em >--verbose</em>, but is suppressed once
        <em >natlog</em> runs as a daemon.
<p>
<li> <strong >--syslog-facility</strong>=<em >facility</em><br/>
       The facility that is used to write the syslog messages to. By default
        this is <em >DAEMON</em>. For an overview of facilities and their meanings,
        see, e.g., <strong >syslog</strong>(3). With <em >natlog</em> the facilities <em >DAEMON,
        LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7</em>, and
        <em >USER</em> can be used.
<p>
<li> <strong >--syslog-priority</strong>=<em >priority</em><br/>
       The priority that is used to write the syslog messages to. By default
        this is <em >NOTICE</em>. For an overview of priorities and their meanings,
        see, e.g., <strong >syslog</strong>(3). With <em >natlog</em> all defined priorities can
        be used. E.g., <em > EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO</em> and
        <em >DEBUG</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--syslog-tag</strong>=<em >tag</em><br/>
       When syslog messages are generated they can be provided with a
        <em >tag</em>, which can be used to filter <em >natlog</em>'s syslog messages from
        the log-files. By default the tag <em >NATLOG</em> is used. See also section
        <em >RSYSLOG FILTERING</em> below.
<p>
<li> <strong >--terminate</strong><br/> 
       When <em >natlog</em> is running as a daemon, a separate command <em >natlog
        --terminate</em> can be issued to terminate the daemon. This assumes that
        the default pid-file (<em >/run/natlog.pid</em>) was used or that a
        non-default pid-file was specified in the default configuration
        file. If not, then the location of the pid-file or the location of the
        non-default configuration file must also be specified. When the daemon
        could be terminated 0 is returned. Otherwise, an error message is
        displayed and 1 is returned,
<p>
<li> <strong >--time</strong>=<em >spec</em> (<strong >-t</strong>)<br/>
        By default time stamps written by <em >natlog</em> are in raw, numeric
        form. E.g.,
        <pre>

NATLOG: From 1338990672:55588 thru 1338990747:807100
        
</pre>

       These time stamps indicate times in seconds:microseconds since the
        beginning of the epoch, January 1, 1970, 0:00 UTC. This option can be
        used to change the seconds part of the time stamps to more
        conventional representations.<br/>
       Specify <em >raw</em> (the default) for the default representation in seconds
        since the epoch; <br/>
       specify <em >utc</em> for a representation like <em >Jun 6 13:29:11</em>, using
        Universal Time Coordinated;<br/>
       specify <em >local</em> for a representation like <em >Jun 6 13:29:11</em>, using
        the local time zone defined by the computer running <em >natlog</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >--ttl</strong>=<em >secs[ui]</em> (<strong >-T</strong>)<br/>
       time-to-live for received connections. At most two time-to-live
        specifications can be provided: for udp/icmp connections a letter
        <em >u</em> must be appended to the specified seconds. By default <em >60u</em> is
        used. For tcp connections a letter <em >t</em> must be appended to the
        specified seconds. By default <em >3000t</em> is used. Both time-to-live
        specifications may be combined: <em >--ttl 120u1800t</em> specifies a
        time-to-live of two minutes for udp/icmp connections and a
        time-to-live of half an hour for tcp connections. Time-to-live is not
        used in conntrack-mode.
<p>
<li> <strong >--verbose</strong> (<strong >-V</strong>)<br/> 
       Additional messages about <em >natlog</em>'s mode of operation are sent to
        the standard output stream. When <em >natlog</em> runs as a daemon these
        messages are sent to the syslog daemon, unless <em >--no-syslog</em> was
        specified. 
<p>
When <em >--verbose</em> is specified twice then all actual configuration
        parameters are shown just before <em >natlog</em> starts.
<p>
When <em >--verbose</em> is specified more often then <em >natlog</em> ends after
        reporting the configuration parameters.
<p>
<li> <strong >--version</strong> (<strong >-v</strong>)<br/> 
       Write <em >natlog</em>'s version number to the standard output stream and
        terminate.
<p>

    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >RSYSLOG FILTERING</h2>
<p>
When using <strong >rsyslogd</strong>(1) property based filters may be used to filter
syslog messages and write them to a file of your choice. E.g., to filter
messages starting with the syslog message tag (e.g., <em >NATLOG</em>) use
        <pre>

:syslogtag, isequal, "NATLOG:"   /var/log/natlog.log
:syslogtag, isequal, "NATLOG:"   stop
        
</pre>

    Note that the colon is part of the tag, but is not specified with the 
<em >syslog-tag</em> option.
<p>
This causes all messages having the <em >NATLOG:</em> tag to be written on
<em >/var/log/natlog.log</em> after which they are discarded. More extensive
filtering is also supported, see, e.g.,
<em >http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/rsyslog_conf_filter.html</em> and
<em >http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/property_replacer.html</em>
<p>
<h2 >EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>
Examples of <em >natlog</em> activations:
    <ul>
    <li> <em >natlog --no-daemon --no-syslog -s br0 eth0</em><br/>
        <em >Natlog</em> remains active as a foreground process, no syslog messages
are written, syslog-equivalent message are written to the standard
output. <em >Natlog</em> uses the pcap library to capture packets from the <em >br0</em>
device, which is active behind the firewall, and to capture packets from the
<em >eth0</em> device, which is the device to where source-natted packages are sent.
<p>
<li> <em >natlog conntrack</em><br/>
        Depending on the options specified in <em >/etc/natlog.conf</em> (or, if not
available, <em >natlog</em>'s default options) source-natted connections are
obtained from <strong >conntrack</strong>(1). By default <em >natlog</em> continues as a daemon
process, generating syslog messages using syslog tags <em >NATLOG:</em>, and
containing information about source-natted connections.
    </ul>
<p>
Here is <em >natlog</em>'s default configuration file. Empty lines and lines
starting with hash-marks (#) are ignored. Options adhere to the following
syntax: 
    <pre>

option  value 
    
</pre>

    Option and value are separated by white space, a colon may be appended to
option names:
<p>
<pre >
# This configuration file shows the default option values.

# all options and values are case sensitive
# see `man natlog' for further details

    # the path and options of the conntrack program:
    # when no filtering options are specified, the tcp
    # protocol is monitored
    # the default command is shown:
#conntrack-command:  /usr/sbin/conntrack -p tcp -E -n -o timestamp \
                                                        -e NEW,DESTROY"

    # the device used by conntrack
#conntrack-device:  /proc/net/nf_conntrack

    # correction for the IP header size 
    # (standard IP header size is 20 bytes)
#conntrack-ip-header-size:  0

    # max. number of conntrack restarts
#conntrack-restart: 10

    # data file for tabular logs (specify path, default: 
    # data file is not used)
#log-data:  

    # flush the log-data file after writing log-data-flush lines
#log-data-flush: 32

    # do not run as a daemon (by default: natlog runs as a daemon)
#no-daemon

    # do not write messages handled by syslog
#no-syslog

    # the path to the pid-file of natlog's daemon process
#pid-file: /run/natlog.pid

    # the protocols that are scanned with the 'conntrack' command:
    #   protocol: all       - monitors tcp, udp, icmp
    #   protocol: udp:tcp   - monitors upd and tcp (any non-empty subset, 
    #                         possibly including icmp is OK)
    # ignored when conntrack-command is specified
#protocol: tcp

    # write messages to stdout (ignored by daemons)
#stdout

    # the default syslog facility:
#syslog-facility: DAEMON

    # the default syslog priority:
#syslog-priority: NOTICE

    # the default syslog tag:
#syslog-tag: NATLOG

    # the time specification:
#time: raw

    # ttl: time to live (seconds) for udp/icmp connections
#ttl: 60

# end of the configuration file
